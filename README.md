## Rede Amor e Esperança

From October 12th to 18th, I participated in Rocketseat #NLW3 for the first time and this is the result so far.

The initial idea was to develop a website for visits to orphanages (shelters), but I decided to innovate and adapt the project for a non-profit organization here in my city, called 'Rede Amor e Esperança'.

Its objective is to collect cans, empty medicine bottles and aerosol deodorants, as well as plastic bottle caps. The sale of these materials is reverted to the purchase of wheelchairs, which are donated to those without financial means.
